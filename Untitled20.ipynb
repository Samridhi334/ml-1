        "1. **What is a parameter?**\n",
        "   A parameter is a configuration variable internal to the model which is estimated from the data during training. E.g., weights in linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is correlation?**\n",
        "   Correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables. Values range from -1 (perfect negative) to 1 (perfect positive).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What does negative correlation mean?**\n",
        "   It means as one variable increases, the other decreases. Example: More exercise, less weight.\n",

        "4. **Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?**\n",
        "   ML is a method of data analysis that automates model building.\n",
